# reverse-pong
The well known retro game Pong but with a twist.

To set up the project for editing simply:
1. Make a 2D project on Unity (use 2020.2.2f1, unsure about other versions but let me know if others work)
2. Open the project directory
3. Delete the 'Assets' folder
4. Place all downloaded files (that being the source code above) in the project directory
5. Have fun making stuff to my game
